I intially thought it would be a good learning experience for me but even after working for  2-3 months as a data entry person i was never exposed to the analytical part. I tried to let the team know that i was more interested in the data analytics but i was never given an opportunity to work as a data analyst. <br>The company can be found in the following link: <a href="https://www.nabilbank.com.np/">https://www.nabilbank.com.np/</a></h4>
